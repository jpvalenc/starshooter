To compile:
g++ -c main.cpp player.cpp background.cpp asteroid.cpp [first]
g++ main.o player.o background.o asteroid.o -o sfml-app -lsfml-window -lsfml-system [second]
./sfml-app [third]

to move:
Use the arrow keys, but the right is broken, I was testing diagonal movement and havent set it back to regular right movement.
